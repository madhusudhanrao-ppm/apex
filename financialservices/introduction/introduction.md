# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This Workshop will showcase a real-time retail transaction monitoring application in a retail or financial services (banking) environment.

**Use-Case:** Transactions are approved, rejected or kept on hold based on multiple business rules such as transaction amount, location of customer and merchant, purchase category, transaction frequency, etc. The transactions on hold go through a human review and approval process. Reviewers can also take action on suspected transactions using customer profile document verifications or previous transaction history.

During this process, transaction anomalies are detected, and the cards used for fraudulent transactions are blocked from running recurring transactions.

The Workshop also covers other financial services use cases, such as detecting money laundering and money mules in the system.

Estimated Workshop Time: 3 Hours  

*Estimated Workshop Time can vary depending upon the Labs that you choose to do, and all labs from lab 4 are Optional.*
